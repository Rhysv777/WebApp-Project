                <h3>Are humans the weakest link?</h3>
                <h4>Cybersecurity, human error</h4>
                <p> When people get hacked what do you think is the most common reason? 
                Is it human error or is it something else?
                 There are various reasons why someone may get hacked, and 100% of the time it is human error that gets you
                 introuble in the first place.
                Humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity, no matter how strong someone may believe their technical defences
                 are.
                Opening a email that looks like an advertisement or logging into the wrong website that looked like 
                the webpage you thought you were supposed to be in.
                 There are several things that could be done to make sure you dont get hacked.
                but at the end of the day it is all possible to avoid getting attacked, or loosing contorol to your system.      
                'The reason for this is that humans are fallible and make mistakes.Mistakes in cyber security can have disastrous
                consequences, as we have seen with high-progile data breaches in recent years.
                 Humans are also the easiest target for cybercriminals-Genastra.com

                <h3>Should you pay the hacker?</h3>
                <h4>Cybersecurity, Ransomware</h4>
                <p>
                Im sure we all know what Ransomware is, right?
                If not then heres a small definition:'Ransomware is malware that  encrypts a victim's important files in demand of a payment (ransom) to restore access'-Crowdstrike
                 These type of attacks are targeted to vunerable organizations that have data that can be used for monitary gain for the attacker.
                The is a lot of ways to get into an orgaizations system if there are vulnerablity that the attacker could find by just looking through public information about said organization.
                A lot of people have thoughts about if orginzations should pay to get their networks back from these attckers. 
                The problem with paying the attacker is that you are putting yourself at risk to get hacked/taken over again.
                Even law enforcement suggests not paying due to the fact that it encourges criminal activity and in some instances it is illegal to pay cause its considered funding criminal activities.
                What would you do if your orginzation was attacked by ransomware? would you find away to get your network back or would you pay? 
                Making sure you have the right types of security systems involved and making sure that no one from within is opening any suspsious sites/emails.
                Even having the right people on your security team makes all the difference. 
                Ultimately the best way to avoid this type of situation is to have your network secure to all forms of attack.
